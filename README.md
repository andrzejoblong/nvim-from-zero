# 🧪 Neovim Journey — from IDE to Clear Coding

This repository shows my personal path from using VSCode and PyCharm to using **Neovim**.

It's not only about changing an editor.  
It's about working with focus, peace, and control.  
No lags, no clicking, no waiting.  
Just the keyboard and a setup that I understand and trust.

## 💡 Why Neovim?

- It's fast, simple, and distraction-free
- I can control how I work and test code
- Works great with Pytest, Git, and the terminal
- Helps me stay calm in chaotic projects

---

## 🧰 What’s inside?

- My `init.lua` file and basic Neovim setup
- Plugins I use (like Gitsigns, Telescope, Lualine)
- Pytest integration – running tests from Neovim
- Git tools – blame, diff, staging inside Neovim
- Notes with ideas, solutions, and personal thoughts

---

## 📓 Articles (coming soon)

- `01_neovim_intro.md` – Why I stopped using IDEs
- `02_plugins_i_use.md` – Plugins that really help
- `03_pytest_integration.md` – Testing without a mouse
- `04_git_blame_and_peace.md` – Git inside Vim = peace of mind

---

## 🚀 My Goals

- Replace VSCode and PyCharm for good
- Run Pytest tests from Neovim easily
- Create a Neovim setup I fully understand and control
- Write and share what I learn – for myself, and maybe for others
