# Why I Moved from IDEs to Neovim

For many years, I used tools like VSCode and PyCharm.

They worked fine... until they didn’t.

---

## What started to bother me:

- Slow startup
- Too many clicks
- Too many popups and distractions
- I didn’t understand what was running under the hood

I realized I wanted something:
- faster
- quieter
- and more *mine*

---

## Why Neovim?

- It opens instantly
- Everything happens from the keyboard
- I can run tests, check Git, and write code in one place
- The configuration is plain and simple (and I understand it)

It’s not perfect, but it feels **clean**.  
Like I’m finally in control of my tools — not the other way around.

---

## My goals with this setup

- Write tests and run them without leaving the editor
- Focus on code, not on popups or plugins I don’t use
- Build something I understand line by line
- Share this journey, maybe help someone else

*Just one key at a time.*  
*One plugin at a time.*  
*And less noise.*
